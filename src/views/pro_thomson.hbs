                Pro-Thomson shocks are designed for heavy and tough work, for conditions that demand the most weight and heavy shocks. The Pro-Thomson Shock Absorber is a strong, very strong shock designed especially for heavy duty trucks or off-road pickup trucks, which are going to be in tough road conditions. With these shock absorbers there is no road to affect it, even if there are no roads and they are only stones. <br> <br>

                The design of the Pro-thomson is an ultra resistant design, it has a thick rubber that protects the shaft from debris or dirt, ruling out any problem or failure that can be generated when they are in harsh conditions. <br> <br>

                The Pro-thomson shock is designed in a single tube, being superior to conventional two tube shocks. It is a high pressure gas damper that includes a single cylinder that is divided into two chambers, one filled with pressurized nitrogen gas and the other above it with hydraulic fluid. The gas and oil are separated by a floating piston that prevents any type of aeration or cavitation, and a piston valve assembly that is connected to the stem that is in the fluid part of the tube. This technology makes Pro-thomson shocks one of the best of their kind, avoiding many failures and problems that conventional two-tube shocks often have.
